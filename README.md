# NeuralGCM: Hybrid ML + Physics model of Earth's atmosphere.

NeuralGCM is a package for building hybrid ML+Physics atmospheric models for
weather and climate simulations.

For details see [Neural General Circulation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07222)
publication (arxiv 2023).

## Usage instructions

We recommend using our inference-only API, as shown in the [demo notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/neuralgcm/blob/main/notebooks/demo/inference_demo.ipynb) (we are still working on complete documentation).
Other parts of the NeuralGCM codebase are less stable and will likely be revised in backwards incompatible ways in the future.

Note that evaluation results and archived forecasts for 2020 are also available as part of [WeatherBench2](https://sites.research.google/weatherbench/).
